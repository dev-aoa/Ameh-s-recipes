    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Banana bread is a type of sweet bread that is made 
        using mashed ripe bananas as the main ingredient. 
        It is a popular baked good in many countries, and 
        its origins can be traced back to the Great Depression 
        when households needed to make the most of their 
        ingredients. Banana bread is typically made with a 
        combination of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, 
        and baking powder or soda. Other ingredients such as 
        nuts, chocolate chips, or cinnamon can also be added 
        to enhance the flavor. Banana bread is often served as a 
        breakfast or dessert item and is enjoyed by many for its 
        moist texture and delicious banana flavor.
