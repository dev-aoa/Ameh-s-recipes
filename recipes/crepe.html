    <p>
        A crepe is a very thin pancake that originated 
        in France. It is made from a mixture of flour, 
        eggs, milk, and butter. The batter is poured onto 
        a hot, flat griddle or pan and cooked until it is 
        thin and delicate. Crepes are usually served with 
        a variety of sweet or savory fillings, such as 
        fruit, Nutella, cheese, ham, or vegetables. 
        They can be folded or rolled into a tube shape and 
        are often eaten as a dessert or breakfast dish.
